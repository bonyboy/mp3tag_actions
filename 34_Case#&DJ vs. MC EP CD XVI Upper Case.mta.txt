Adjusts Dj Dolores to DJ, while maintaining gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt. It lowercases “vs” and UPPERCASES a few abbreviations like UK, OC, CA, and others. Add in your own to suit your taste (Separate|with|vertical|pipes). This also finds roman numerals at least up to the thirties (XXIX). The numeral action was made by dano over at the mp3tag forums, but it suffered from incorrectly capitalizing I’M, I’D, and the common MIX. It also stripped commas out of tags. I wasn’t sure how to resolve all those problems so I made my own edits and reduced the lettering to only be concerned with I, V, X, and C; and all works fine now. Talk about World War III Blues.
